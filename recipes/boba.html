        <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
        <p class="text">Boba tea, or bubble tea, is a popular drink that originated from Taiwan. I made this coconut variation because I had coconut cream on hand and wanted something different from the regular black milk tea variation. This coconut version tastes just like the one you'll find in a bubble tea cafe.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="text-step">
            <li>7 cups cold water</li>
            <li>½ (8.8 ounce) package tapioca starch balls</li>
            <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li> etc... </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="text-step">
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large stockpot. Pour in tapioca and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from heat and let balls sit in water for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return stockpot to the heat; simmer and stir for 25 minutes more. Remove from heat and let rest again until centers of the balls are no longer powder, another 25 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar and white sugar bowl. Pour tapioca balls into the sugar mixture. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes while preparing the tea.</li>
        </ol>
